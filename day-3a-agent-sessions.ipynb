    "A session is a container for conversations. It encapsulates the conversation history in a chronological manner and also records all tool interactions and responses for a **single, continuous conversation**. A session is tied to a user and agent; it is not shared with other users. Similarly, a session history for an Agent is not shared with other Agents.\n",

    "> - *User Input*: A message from the user (text, audio, image, etc.)\n",
    "> - *Agent Response*: The agent's reply to the user\n",
    "> - *Tool Call*: The agent's decision to use an external tool or API\n",

      "\n",
      "**1. AI for Drug Discovery and Development:**\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Accelerated Drug Discovery:** AI is revolutionizing the pace at which new drugs are discovered. Companies are using AI to analyze vast biological datasets, identify potential drug targets, predict drug efficacy and toxicity, and even design novel molecules. This is significantly shortening the pre-clinical stages of drug development.\n",
      "*   **Personalized Medicine:** AI is enabling the development of highly personalized therapies. By analyzing a patient's genetic data, medical history, and lifestyle factors, AI can predict which treatments will be most effective for them, minimizing trial-and-error.\n",
      "*   **Clinical Trial Optimization:** AI is being used to improve the design and execution of clinical trials. This includes identifying suitable patient populations, predicting patient recruitment rates, and analyzing trial data more efficiently.\n",
      "\n",
      "**2. AI in Diagnostics and Imaging:**\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Enhanced Medical Imaging Analysis:** AI algorithms are becoming incredibly adept at analyzing medical images like X-rays, CT scans, and MRIs. They can detect subtle anomalies that might be missed by the human eye, aiding in the early diagnosis of diseases such as cancer, diabetic retinopathy, and cardiovascular conditions.\n",
      "*   **Pathology Advancements:** AI is assisting pathologists in analyzing tissue samples, identifying cancerous cells, and grading tumors more accurately and consistently.\n",
      "*   **Early Disease Detection:** Beyond imaging, AI is being developed to analyze other types of data (e.g., electronic health records, wearable sensor data) for early signs of diseases, potentially allowing for interventions before symptoms become severe.\n",
      "\n",
      "**3. AI in Clinical Operations and Workflow:**\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Administrative Task Automation:** AI is helping to reduce the administrative burden on healthcare professionals by automating tasks like scheduling appointments, managing patient records, processing insurance claims, and transcribing doctor's notes.

      "User > Are there any new developments in drug discovery?\n",
      "gemini-2.5-flash-lite >  Yes, there are constant and exciting new developments in drug discovery, largely driven by advancements in AI and other technologies. Here are some of the key areas seeing significant progress:\n",
      "\n",
      "**1. AI-Powered Drug Design and Optimization:**\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Generative AI for Novel Molecules:** This is a major area. Instead of just screening existing libraries, generative AI models (like GANs, VAEs, and transformer-based models) are now being used to *design* entirely new molecular structures with desired properties from scratch. These models can be trained on vast chemical databases and biological data to predict which novel compounds are most likely to bind to a specific target, be effective, and have favorable safety profiles.\n",
      "*   **Predictive Modeling for Efficacy and Toxicity:** AI is becoming much better at predicting how a potential drug will behave in the body. This includes predicting its binding affinity to target proteins, its pharmacokinetic properties (how it's absorbed, distributed, metabolized, and excreted), and its potential toxic side effects. This helps researchers prioritize the most promising candidates and de-prioritize those likely to fail, saving significant time and money.\n",
      "*   **\"In Silico\" Screening:** AI allows for the rapid screening of millions or billions of virtual compounds against a target, a process that would be prohibitively expensive and time-consuming with traditional laboratory methods.\n",
      "\n",
      "**2. Targeting Previously \"Undruggable\" Targets:**\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Protein-Protein Interactions (PPIs):** Many diseases are driven by the disruption of interactions between proteins. Historically, these interactions have been very difficult to target with small molecule drugs. New AI approaches are helping to identify and design molecules that can modulate these PPIs.\n",
      "*   **RNA-Targeting Therapies:** Beyond DNA and proteins, researchers are increasingly looking at RNA as a therapeutic target. AI can help identify and design molecules that can interact with specific RNA sequences to regulate gene expression.\n",
      "\n",
      "**3. Advances in Specific Therapeutic Modalities:**\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Antibody-Drug Conjugates (ADCs):** AI is being used to optimize the selection of antibodies, linkers, and potent cytotoxic payloads to create more effective and targeted ADCs for cancer treatment.\n",
      "*   **CRISPR and Gene Therapies:** While not strictly \"drug discovery\" in the traditional sense, AI is playing a role in identifying optimal gene targets and designing delivery vectors for gene editing and therapy.\n",
      "*   **Peptide Therapeutics:** AI is helping to design novel peptide sequences with improved stability and therapeutic properties for various conditions.\n",
      "\n",
      "**4. Real-World Data and Real-World Evidence (RWE):**\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Leveraging EHRs and Claims Data:** AI can analyze massive datasets from electronic health records (EHRs), insurance claims, and patient registries to identify unmet needs, understand disease progression, and discover potential drug repurposing opportunities.\n",
      "*   **Identifying Patient Subgroups:** AI can help identify specific patient subgroups who are most likely to respond to a particular drug, leading to more targeted clinical trials and personalized treatments.\n",
      "\n",
      "**5. Automation and Robotics in the Lab:**\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **High-Throughput Screening (HTS) Enhancement:** AI is integrated with robotic systems to automate and optimize experimental workflows, allowing for the rapid testing of more compounds and conditions.\n",
      "*   **Automated Experiment Design:** AI can even suggest and design the next set of experiments to be performed, creating a self-optimizing research loop.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Examples of Companies and Initiatives:**\n",
      "\n",
      "Many companies are at the forefront of these advancements, including:\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Recursion Pharmaceuticals:** Uses AI and automation to map biological responses to disease and identify potential drug targets.\n",
      "*   **Exscientia:** Employs AI to design novel drug molecules for various diseases.\n",

      "User > Tell me more about the second development you found.\n",
      "gemini-2.5-flash-lite >  You're asking about the second development I mentioned: **Targeting Previously \"Undruggable\" Targets**. This is a really significant area in drug discovery because historically, a large proportion of disease-causing proteins and pathways have been very difficult to modulate with traditional drugs.\n",
      "\n",
      "Let's break down why certain targets are considered \"undruggable\" and how new approaches are overcoming these challenges:\n",
      "\n",
      "**Why are some targets \"Undruggable\"?**\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Lack of Clear Binding Pockets:** Many proteins involved in disease don't have the well-defined, concave binding sites that small molecule drugs typically latch onto. They might have flat surfaces or shallow grooves that are hard for small molecules to bind to with sufficient affinity and specificity.\n",
      "*   **Protein-Protein Interactions (PPIs):** A huge number of critical biological processes are regulated by proteins interacting with each other. These interactions often involve large, dynamic, and relatively flat surfaces rather than small, rigid pockets. Designing small molecules that can effectively disrupt or stabilize these complex interactions has been a major hurdle.\n",
      "*   **Intrinsically Disordered Proteins (IDPs):** Some proteins lack a stable, three-dimensional structure under physiological conditions. They are flexible and can adopt different shapes depending on their binding partners. This inherent flexibility makes it challenging to design drugs that can consistently bind to them.\n",
      "*   **Intracellular Targets:** Drugs need to enter cells to reach their targets. Some intracellular targets are difficult to access or are located in cellular compartments where drugs struggle to penetrate.\n",
      "*   **Specificity Issues:** Even if a drug can bind to a target, ensuring it only binds to the *intended* target and not other similar proteins is crucial to avoid off-target side effects.\n",
      "\n",
      "**How New Developments are Overcoming These Challenges:**\n",
      "\n",
      "1.  **Advanced AI/Machine Learning for PPIs:**\n",
      "    *   **Predictive Modeling:** AI algorithms are being trained on vast datasets of known protein structures and interactions. They can learn complex patterns to predict *which* proteins are likely to interact and *where* on their surfaces these interactions occur.\n",
      "    *   **De Novo Design of Modulators:** Instead of just looking for existing molecules, AI can now design entirely new molecules (often larger than traditional small molecules, or with novel chemistries) specifically tailored to bind to the large, flat surfaces involved in PPIs. These can be:\n",
      "        *   **Peptide-based drugs:** AI can design peptides that mimic or block specific protein interaction interfaces.\n",
      "        *   **Macrocycles:** Larger ring-like molecules that can better engage with larger binding areas.\n",
      "        *   **Allosteric Modulators:** Drugs that bind to a site *different* from the primary interaction site, but by doing so, change the protein's shape or activity in a way that affects the interaction. AI is proving adept at identifying these allosteric sites and designing molecules for them.\n",
      "\n",
      "2.  **Targeting RNA:**\n",
      "    *   **RNA Structure Prediction:** AI is improving our ability to predict the complex 3D structures of RNA molecules. Understanding RNA structure is key to designing drugs that can bind to it.\n",
      "    *   **RNA-Targeting Small Molecules (RTSMs) and Antisense Oligonucleotides:** Researchers are developing small molecules and short nucleic acid sequences that can bind to specific RNA molecules, either to block their translation into protein (silencing genes) or to modify their function. AI helps in identifying target RNA sequences and designing these binding molecules.\n",
      "\n",
      "3.  **New Therapeutic Modalities:**\n",
      "    *   **PROTACs (Proteolysis-Targeting Chimeras):** These are bifunctional molecules that \"hijack\" the cell's natural protein degradation machinery. One end of the PROTAC binds to the target protein, and the other end binds to an E3 ubiquitin ligase. The cell then marks the target protein for destruction. AI is being used to design optimal PROTAC molecules, including selecting the right ligands for both the target and the E3 ligase, and designing the linker between them. This is a powerful way to eliminate proteins that were previously undruggable because they lacked enzymatic activity or a clear binding pocket.\n",
      "    *   **Degrader molecules (e.g., SNIPs - Small Molecule PROTACs):** Similar to PROTACs, these are smaller molecules designed to induce degradation of target proteins.\n",
      "\n",
      "4.  **Enhanced Computational Chemistry and Structural Biology:**\n",
      "    *   **Advanced Simulation Techniques:** More powerful computational methods and increased processing power allow for more accurate simulations of how molecules interact with complex protein surfaces and flexible targets.\n",
      "    *   **Cryo-EM and X-ray Crystallography:** These experimental techniques provide detailed 3D structures of proteins, including those that were previously difficult to crystallize. AI is also assisting in the interpretation of these complex structural datasets.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Impact:**\n",
      "\n",
      "By successfully targeting previously \"undruggable\" proteins and pathways, researchers are opening up entirely new avenues for treating diseases that have historically lacked effective therapies, such as certain cancers, neurodegenerative disorders, and autoimmune diseases. This represents a significant expansion of the druggable genome and proteome.\n",

    "In this example, we used ADK's default summarizer. For more advanced use cases, you can provide your own by defining a custom `SlidingWindowCompactor` and passing it to the config. This allows you to control the summarization prompt or even use a different, specialized LLM for the task. You can read more about it in the [official documentation](https://google.github.io/adk-docs/context/compaction/).\n",
